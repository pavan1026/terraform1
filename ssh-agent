1. Using a Mac or Linux Client Computer

Configuring the SSH agent on a Mac:

Run the following command:

ssh-add -K myPrivateKey.pem



ssh-add -L myPrivateKey.pem


Connect to the bastion host from Mac/Linux:

You can now ssh into the EC2 instance bastion host by issuing the following command:

ssh –A ec2-user@<bastion-IP-address or DNS-entry>

Connect to the private instances from the bastion host:

Now that you’ve used agent forwarding you can simply connect to any instance that is using the same key pair by simply issuing the following command:

ssh ec2-user@<instance-IP-address or DNS-entry>
